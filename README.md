- mainly: hyper-optimized london deck minus cheesemonger, assuming bonemarket and rat market are always open with all seasons/fluctuations available, endgame levels in everything

- 100% chance I'm overlooking many relevant factors but those at least seem like sane numbers with some basis in reality
